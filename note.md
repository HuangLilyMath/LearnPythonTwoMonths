# Python

## 2019.02.18

Today, I learned how to print.For example:

```python
print("Hello,world").
```
**Remark**:Anything after the `#` is ignored by python.

The symbol `%` means taking the remainder.For example:

5%2=1.

Today,I learned exercise 0,1,2,3.And it is not hard .Just do it!

**Remark** The symbol `_` is called underscore character.We We use this character a lot to put an imaginary space between words in variable names.For example:

```python
space_in_a_car=4.0
```



In exercise 5,I learned how to make strings that have variables embedded in them.For example:

```py
my_name = 'Huang'
print(f"Hello,{my_name}.")
```

Today,I learned exercise 4,5,6,7.It is not hard.But there are some places I can't understand.

**Question** What does the symbol `end=''`mean?

For example:

```py
end1 = "C"
end2 =" h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"
```

There two cases:

```pyth
# watch end = ' ' at the end. try removing it to see what happens
print(end1+end2+end3+end4+end5+end6,end = '')
print(end7+end8+end9+end10+end11+end12)
```

The result is 

Cheese Burger

```py
# watch end = ' ' at the end. try removing it to see what happens
print(end1+end2+end3+end4+end5+end6)
print(end7+end8+end9+end10+end11+end12)
```

The result is

Cheese

Burger

Maybe adding `end = ''`means not changing the line.
